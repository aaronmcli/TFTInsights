    "Team Fight Tactics (TFT) is an auto-battler stratgery game developed by Riot Games, local to west Los Angeles, set in the League of Legends universe. Players compete in 8-player free-for-all matches, where each round consists of automatic battles between squads of units that the player builds over time (hence the name auto-battler). The goail is to be the last player standing by strategically managing your economogy, positioning, and __most critcally__ your team composition. \n",

    "# Core Mechanics\n",
    "- __Unit Drafting__ : Player acquire units from a shared pool using gold. Units have different origins and classes (aka traits).\n",
    "- __Trait Synergies__ :Units with matching traits grant bonuses, making synergies the foundation of strong team compositions.\n",
    "- __Economy Management__: Player earn gold each round, and must balance spending on units, leveling up, and saving for interest.\n",
    "- __Positioning__: Units are placed on a grid, and while they act automatically in combat, smart placement can greatly affect outcomesâ€”changing who gets targeted, how long key units survive, and whether abilities land effectively.\n",
    "- __Augments & Items__: Augments add game-changing bonuses; where items crafted from components drastically empower unit performance."
