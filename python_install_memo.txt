Installing a Python environment on your computer can be done in many ways, and it can be a notoriously finicky process.  Below, I describe how to do it using a virtual environment with Anaconda.  Please do note:

If you want to do it another way, you are quite welcome to explore other options.
If you already have the packages on your system, you do not need to follow any instructions below.
If you have any trouble at any step, please ask so we can sort out any issues.
We will be setting up Python 3.10 along with the following:

jupyterlab
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
seaborn
plotly
ipywidgets
statsmodels
scikit-learn
yellowbrick
dtreeviz
xgboost
nltk
gensim
tensorflow==2.17
jax
Instructions

Install Anaconda
See the instructions here:  https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install
Download requirements.txt Download requirements.txtand TF_JAX_Test.ipynb Download TF_JAX_Test.ipynbto your home directory (or another folder of your choice).  If your username is "<USERNAME>" then:
On Windows, the home directory is C:\Users\<USERNAME>\
On Mac, the home directory is /Users/<USERNAME>
On Linux, the home directory is /home/<USERNAME>
Open a terminal and navigate to the same home directory (or location in which you saved the files)
On Mac and Linux, you can do this by opening the application called Terminal
On Windows, open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start Menu
In all likelihood, you will automatically be in the home directory when you open these applications
If you have saved the files into a non-home directory, change into the directory containing the saved files
We will now create a virtual environment. 
This will be useful to isolate our installed packages so that they do not create conflicts if you decide to create other Python projects in the future.
create the environment by executing the following command in the terminal:
conda create -n uclax-ml -c conda-forge python=3.10
in the above, you can change "uclax-ml" to be another name if you want
the command will check for packages and then prompt you to confirm that it's ok to proceed
When it's created, activate the environment by executing conda activate uclax-ml
You will need to do this every time you open a new terminal and want to interact with the installed packages
Install the python packages into the environment by executing pip install -r requirements.txt
Execute the following to re-initialize the environment (we're installing jupyterlab and this will make sure we refresh the path)
conda deactivate uclax-ml
conda activate uclax-ml
Check that you have a working installation of JupyterLab, JAX, and TensorFlow by doing the following:
In the terminal, execute jupyter lab
This should open JupyterLab in a new web browser tab, and you should see a menu listing files/folders that are in your directory
Double-click on the file "TF_JAX_Test.ipynb"
Execute the cells
If you see any error messages, let me know.  Otherwise, you are good to go!
Close down the notebook, shut down the JupyterLab session by selecting File -> Shut Down, and exit out of your terminal
Remember that the next time you want to interact with the environment, you'll need to again open a terminal and execute conda activate uclax-ml, followed by jupyter lab if you want to then open JupyterLab
